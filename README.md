## Blocktators
Blocktators is an NFT collection on Polygon with OpenSea. The Potato characters
are satirical depictions of people that have too enormous influence on the 
narratives and policies that shape and change our world. This is a fun
project and the characters are created both to revere and critcize the
individuals they depict.

Our intention for this project is to learn how to create the NFTs and 
use Polygon and OpenSea. 

## Art
Art has been created with Abobe in SVG. The potatoes are meant to mock the
significance of how changing the world and social impact agendas often people
religiously dogmatic.

## Contracts
We have decided to use the OpenSea dashboard to deploy these contracts, but in
future versions we may pick up the contracts at a lower lever to see if there
is anything interesting that can be done.

## Whitepaper
We have explored the use of LaTex to create our whitepaper as this technology
is usefull in other professional projects and it has been informative to get
the toolchain setup to use LaTex here.
